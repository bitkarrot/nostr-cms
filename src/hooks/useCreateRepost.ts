/**
 * Hook for creating NIP-18 reposts (kind 6 / kind 16).
 *
 * Supports:
 * - Immediate repost (publish now)
 * - Scheduled repost (publish at a future time via the scheduler)
 * - Repeating scheduled reposts (multiple reposts at regular intervals)
 *
 * Scheduled reposts use a two-phase approach:
 *   Phase 1 — sign all events upfront (no network calls).
 *   Phase 2 — schedule each signed event sequentially via the scheduler API.
 *
 * If any signing fails in Phase 1, nothing is scheduled — clean failure.
 * If some scheduling calls fail in Phase 2, the `failed` array in the result
 * contains the signed events that were not scheduled. The caller can retry
 * just those by passing them back via `preSignedEvents`.
