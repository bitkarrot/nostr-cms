## Configuration

### Relays
- **Primary Relay**: Configured via `VITE_DEFAULT_RELAY`. This is the main source for reading and the first destination for publishing.

  - `wss://relay.primal.net` 
  - `wss://nos.lol`
- **Admin Control**: Admins can dynamically add or remove publishing relays via the system settings.

### Admin Access
Admin access is controlled by a remote `nostr.json` file (configured via `VITE_REMOTE_NOSTR_JSON_URL`). The site automatically detects users and maps roles based on the Master Pubkey.

## NIPs Used

- **NIP-01**: Basic protocol flow
- **NIP-05**: Mapping Nostr keys to DNS-based identifiers
- **NIP-23**: Long-form content for blog posts
- **NIP-47**: Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC)
- **NIP-52**: Calendar events for meetups
- **NIP-25**: Event RSVP functionality
- **NIP-57**: Lightning Zaps
- **NIP-nsite (Type 34128)**: Static page mapping

## Admin Features In-Depth

### System Settings & Reset
The **Admin Settings** page allows the Master User to:
- Assign roles to other admins.
- Configure site-wide branding and metadata.
- Manage the relay list.
- Use the **Reset to Defaults** feature to purge all custom configuration and return to the `VITE_` environment variable state.

### Static Pages (Kind 34128)
Admins can create custom URL paths (e.g., `/about`, `/contact`) and upload content (HTML/Markdown) to Blossom. These are mapped using Kind 34128 events, allowing the site to serve decentralized static content.

## Public Features In-Depth

### Community Zapping
Users can send Bitcoin via Lightning Network zaps to authors of blog posts and events. The site supports:
- **WebLN**: Browser extensions like Alby.
- **NWC**: Cross-device wallet connections.
- **QR Codes**: Manual scanning for mobile or desktop wallets.

## Security
- Admin access is cryptographically verified based on the remote `nostr.json`.
- Sensitve configurations are stored in environment variables.
- No private keys are stored on the server; all signing happens via local clients or NWC.
